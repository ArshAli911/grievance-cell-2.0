## Overview

The Grievance Cell System is a modular, FastAPI-based backend application designed to streamline grievance management within organizations. It allows users to raise issues, employees to address them, and administrators to oversee the entire workflow—all secured via JWT Bearer authentication and role-based access control.

---

## Features

* **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based signup and login.
* **Role-Based Access Control**: Four roles (`user`, `employee`, `admin`, `super_admin`) with distinct permissions.
* **Hierarchical Entities**: Users belong to Departments. Grievances link to both Users and Departments.
* **Automated Load Balancing**: Pending grievances auto-assigned evenly across employees.
* **Ticketing**: Each grievance gets a unique UUID ticket.
* **Timestamps & Auditing**: Creation and resolution timestamps, plus `resolved_by` tracking.
* **Comments**: Inline commenting on grievances with user and timestamp metadata.
* **Modular Structure**: Separate folders for each domain (User, Department, Grievances, Comments).
* **🔍 Substring Search**: Search grievances by keywords (title, description, or ticket ID)
* **📊 Sorting Support**: Sort grievances by status, date, or department

---

## Architecture & Technologies

* **Framework**: FastAPI
* **Authentication**: JWT Bearer via `fastapi.security.HTTPBearer`
* **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
* **Password Hashing**: Passlib bcrypt scheme
* **API Documentation**: Swagger UI (`/docs`)
* **Code Structure**:

  * `User/` — Models, Schemas, CRUD, APIs
  * `Department/` — Models, Schemas, CRUD, APIs
  * `Grievances/` — Models, Schemas, CRUD, APIs
  * `Comments/` — Models, Schemas, CRUD, APIs
  * `auth.py`, `dependencies.py`, `roles.py`, `database.py`, `main.py`

### 💡 Example Usage

- Search for grievances that contain the keyword "internet":


- List grievances with status = "OPEN", sorted by creation date ascending:

- Filter grievances created after January 1, 2024, and assigned to employee ID 5:

- Return 10 grievances starting from the 11th record (pagination):


---

### 🛠 Developer Notes (Backend Logic)

The grievance filtering and sorting logic follows the steps below:

1. Start with a base SQLAlchemy query on the Grievance model.
2. Apply role-based access filters:
 - If the user is a normal user: filter grievances submitted by them.
 - If the user is an employee: filter grievances in their department and assigned to them.
 - If the user is an admin: filter grievances only within their department.
3. Apply optional filters (if provided in the query parameters):
 - Filter by status, user_id, department_id, assigned_to.
 - Filter by creation date range (created_after, created_before).
 - Perform a case-insensitive partial match (ILIKE) on grievance description and ticket ID if a search term is provided.
4. Determine the field to sort by (`sort_by`):
 - Validate the field against known columns.
 - Default to `created_at` if an invalid field is given.
5. Apply sorting direction (`asc` or `desc`).
6. Apply pagination using offset and limit.
7. Use eager loading (`joinedload`) to prefetch related models such as:
 - User (grievance submitter)
 - Department
 - Assigned employee
 - Attachments
8. Execute the final query and return the grievance list.

This modular design supports flexible querying and is easily extendable for future enhancements such as priority filters, tags, or additional user roles.
